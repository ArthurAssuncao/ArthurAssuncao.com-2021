  "I was born in Barbacena, Brazil, I was an underresourced young that studied in public schools without much life perspective. I was a nerd, nothing popular, but had a dream, study and work with embedded systems and I would like to do Computer Technician or Automation (embedded systems). In Barbacena, there was no course about embedded systems like automation and I don't knew that there was a course technical in informatics. Furthermore, no one teacher believed in me or another student from my class. And I don't have money to live in another city.",
  '"Life was not easy, but I wanted to change my life, I hated that situation."',
  `Then I discovered Internet Systems graduation course, which I tried in, but I'm failed. In the next year, I tried again, tried Computer Technician and Internet Systems, in my city, and I'm passed in both. I do not knew, yet at this moment my life never would be the same.
In the graduation course, I studied every day, tried to be better, the best. I sacrificed my social life to study because I believed which this was the path. I created games before other students and without no one teacher's request.`,
  `And you know the reason I made these games? I loved programming, I loved to create things, I love learning and I love growing up. In the third college semester, after reading almost the whole Java How to Program book, I got an internship with Mobile Development, and I knew one thing: 'Nothing will stop me'.`,
  '"I can learn what I want."',
  `I did another internship, projects, and other stuff. Technology changes my life and today I'm glad for all my actions in the last years.`,
  `And now... Are we going to change a great number of lives through Technology?`,
